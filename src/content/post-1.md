#### Hi! I'm Russell Carter Jr.

I'm a software engineer in Baltimore, MD.

I'll be using this blog to pass on what I learn as a developer and to connect with other like-minded people.

My interests span anywhere from clever frontend tricks to fundamental algorithms in C. I love to learn and I am inspired by the amazing engineering that got us to where we are today.

Aside from writing code, some of my hobbies include playing soccer, learning jiu-jitsu, reading, and gaming.

If you're wondering who the heck the dude on the tab to this site is and why I'm already assuming you're my friend, allow me to introduce you to the [greatest show of all time.](https://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot) If you already know, bonsoir ðŸ˜Ž.

#### Please feel free to reach out to me on any social, or email me at <russell.c12@gmail.com>.
